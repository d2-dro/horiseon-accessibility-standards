# horiseon-accessibility-standards
Code for Horizeon's website was refactored to be made more dry and to include more semantic html elements. Comments were included to reference css effects. The result of this effort was to improve accessibility and search engine optimization.

The webpage was given a title and does not appear any different when compared to the previous version.

The deployed application can be found here: https://d2-dro.github.io/horiseon-accessibility-standards/
